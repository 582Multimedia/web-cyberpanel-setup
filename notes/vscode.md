# VSCode setup

Visual Studio Code is our tool of choice for creating web pages and sites. They are already installed in the school computers.

However, if you want to use it at home, you can [download VSCode here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

First, make sure you have your details for your site on hand, you will need the following:

- the path to your website (in our example, it is example89.582domain.com)
- your ssh/sftp user name and password (in our example, it is example6453)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user name for SSH/SFTP is **NOT** the same as your Cyber Panel / path to your website, so make sure they are used in the right place.
